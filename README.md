# Repeating-Decimal
 * This program asks for three repeating iterations of a number. It gets the number by  
 * dividing the inputted string in thirds after establishing the front number (the number 
 * before the decimal) and the decimal. An example is inputting the string: "1.123123123", 
 * in which it will take off the first number, "1", and get the decimal, "123123123", and 
 * divide the decimal into three, using the length of the string divided by three, leaving 
 * us with "123". This will be converted into an int after getting the length of the string 
 * left over, 3. The numerator will be calculated by my own algorithm, and divided by a 
 * summation equation, such that the denominator will be 9, 99, 999, 9999,... etc.
